It's only the front-end page where we can manually add the details of the login data in a code.
whenever we enter the data it checks the details which are matched with code or not and if it's not than it shows the error message and if it is so it will redirect to the particular path.

for example here the E-mail id: 123@gmail.com and the pass: 123321
after click on submit it will redirect to the youtube.
